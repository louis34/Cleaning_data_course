# Cleaning_data_course

For this project, I downloaded the data to my computer, then extracted the X_train, X_test and features files and placed it in a new folder on my computer.
I then performed the following steps which allowed me to download the text files, X_train and X_test, to merge them, to calculate the average and the sd on 
each column, then to insert the names of the columns thanks to the feature file. Finally I added a column specifying if the data came from X_train or X_test 
and I created a dataframe where for each subject X_train and X_test, we have their averages for each column of the table.

# 0/ Dowload the data of X_train and X_test-------------------
# 1/ Merge the two files X_train and X_test----------------
# 2/ Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
# 3/ Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set------------------
# 4/ Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names------------------
# 5/From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject--------------
# 6 Add a Source column to identify X and Y data
# 7 Check the number of X_test and X_train
# 8 Create a data frame specified by subject
# 9 Calculate the mean by each subject
# 10 Rename the column "Group.1" by "People"
# 11 Extract the data with write.table
